Where did Redux come from?
</h1>

Redux was created in 2015 by Dan Abramov.

Redux was created to simplify Flux.

Flux had a bunch of boilerplate code that was unnecessary. (things to create a flux app)

Dan also wanted to elimanate some of the problems he was facing when it came to debugging.

Dan envisioned dev tools that would allow him to undo or replay a series of actions at the click of a button.

Dans vision became the React DevTools.

Redux updates state using pure functions called Reducers.

One can simply replay a series of actions and be guaranteed to arrive at the same final state.

Redux also becomes more convenient to use a single object to use a single object  to store the state,
as opposed to traditional Flux which uses multiple store.
